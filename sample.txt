Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
There are three main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.
Reinforcement learning trains an agent to make decisions by rewarding desired behaviors and penalizing mistakes.
Popular algorithms in ML include linear regression, decision trees, k-means clustering, and neural networks.
Feature engineering is a key process where raw data is transformed into meaningful input for models.
Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score help measure model performance.
ML is widely used in recommendation systems, fraud detection, image recognition, and natural language processing.
Ethical concerns in ML include data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the explainability of model decisions.
